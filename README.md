In this supplemental repository, you will find the saved ResNet models from our article along with additional plots too numerous to be submitted with the paper. Additionally, you will find a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates inferencing using our models. You may choose between the Kullback_Leibler (KLD) model or the Categorical Crossentropy (CXE) model by commenting/uncommenting the appropriate line in the first code cell. The second cell will run an inferencing function on a small set of sample character images from the AL-PUB dataset. For more information on the dataset, please visit <a href="https://data.cs.mtsu.edu/al-pub"/>https://data.cs.mtsu.edu/al-pub/</a>.
